# Shopify Connector v3.01.03 Release Notes

_Release Date: August 12, 2026_

## Bug Fixes and Performance Enhancements

### Order Download Failure on Orders with Refunded Line Items

Some orders with discounted line items were failing to download from Shopify due to a database error on the discount table (`PS_DOC_DISC`). This happened when an order included a line item that had been fully refunded down to a zero quantity, which caused the connector to attempt to insert a discount record for the 0 quantity item and fail the download.

- The connector's order creation process now excludes line items with a current quantity of 0 when building the order, preventing that discount record from being created.
- This resolves order download errors such as "Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_PS_DOC_DISC'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.PS_DOC_DISC'."

### Friendlier Error Message for Misaligned Shopify Variants

Previously, if an item was synced to Shopify, and that product already had pre-existing variants that didn't match the grid cells or alternate units from Counterpoint, the connector failed with a generic technical error.

- When this happens, the connector now shows a friendly error explaining that the pre-existing Shopify variants should be removed (or that the Shopify product and the Shopify Item Record should be fully recreated) before resyncing.
- This replaces raw errors such as "BulkCreateVariant failed," "Sequence contains no matching element," or "Sequence contains more than one matching element."
